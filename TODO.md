- [x] Replace ABC with Protocol
    - **[Rationale](https://peps.python.org/pep-0544/#rationale-and-goals)**
    - [Interface segregation principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)
    - [Design by contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract)
    - [Nominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system) vs [structural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system) type system
    - [Every class is a type](https://peps.python.org/pep-0483/#types-vs-classes)
    - [Existing Approaches to Structural Subtyping](https://peps.python.org/pep-0544/#existing-approaches-to-structural-subtyping)
        - > ABCs in `typing` module already provide **structural behavior at runtime**, isinstance(Bucket(), Iterable) returns True. The main goal of this proposal is to **support such behavior statically**.
    - [Abstract Base Classes and Protocols](https://jellis18.github.io/post/2022-01-11-abc-vs-protocol/)
    - > In object-oriented programming, an interface or protocol type is a data type describing a set of method signatures, the implementations of which may be provided by multiple classes that are otherwise not necessarily related to each other. A class which provides the methods listed in a protocol is said to adopt the protocol, or to implement the interface. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(object-oriented_programming)).
    - `isinstance()` with protocols is not completely safe at runtime.

- [x] Solved. See https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/pull/180#discussion_r1038995462. Fix `pip-compile gym[classic_control] -> gym[classic-control]`. See https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/1576 for more details.
